#### More

This web scraper extracts the audio files from Madeon's Adventure Machine, found
at http://www.madeon.fr/adventuremachine/ and written by http://wemakeawesomesh.it/. The scraper was originally written so I could import said audio files into Ableton Live and build a jam session for my Novation Launchpad Mini. In April 2015 I shared the audio files via Dropbox and received significant interest from the /r/edmproduction, /r/ableton, and /r/abletonlive subreddits. That link usually gets a weekly message of gratitude; when Adventure Machine is reposted,
I get a lot more. I am grateful for the attention my code doodle received so I
am comitting this repo for public consumption and updated it for python3 use. If
you haven't listened to Madeon's Adventure album, it is excellent!

#### Ableton Live Set

The Ableton Live project is called Madeon - Adventure Machine Jam Project and provides a rough sketch of how I would setup the midi mappings and organize my tracks. I doubt I would perform with this setup because the stops and view change is a mess, and developing horizontal scenes would make phrasing better.

This set was built in Ableton Live 9 Standard 64-bit (9.2.3 Build)
