## MadeonScraper

A web scraper to extract the audio files from Madeon's super awesome Adventure
Machine!

## More

This web scraper extracts the audio files from Madeon's Adventure Machine, found
at http://www.madeon.fr/adventuremachine/. It was originally written so I could
import said audio files into Ableton Live and build a jam session for my
Novation Launchpad. In April 2015 I shared the audio files via Dropbox
at https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ururt0l2dqiloa/MadeonAdventure.zip?dl=0 and
received significant interest from the /r/edmproduction, /r/ableton, and
/r/abletonlive subreddits. That link usually gets a weekly message of
gratitude; when Adventure Machine is reposted, I get a lot more. I am grateful
for the attention my code doodle received so I am comitting this repo for public
consumption and it is now python3 compliant. If you haven't listened to Madeon's
Adventure album, it is excellent! Let's hope we get a Porter Robinson & Madeon
Shelter tour release soon!

Happy Scraping!
